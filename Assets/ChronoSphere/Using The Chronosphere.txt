---------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, allow me to explain a few concepts that the Chronosphere operates on:
Day-
	A single length of time that goes from hour 0 to hour 23 and restarts
Shift-
	A segment of a day during which certain settings are applied to an object

Explaining the Chronosphere Controls:
	Day Speed -
		This measures the length of a day, in minutes.
	Hour Start -
		The hour at which the Chronosphere will begin to run. Any number above 23 will be reduced by 23 until it is.
	Sun/Moon/Night Sphere -
		Defines the object that will act as the Sun light/Moon light/Night Sky. These values are fed into the Shifts at run time.
	Sun/Moon/Night Sphere Shifts - 
		Creates an array of Shifts that are used in the transitioning of the color values.
	*NEW*
	Light Clouds, Heavy Clouds, Rain Effect, Lightning-
		Defines the objects that act as part of the weather
	Cloud Shifts
		Changes the color of the clouds depending on the hour, like the Sun shifts
	Forecasts
		Set up weather conditions to switch between during the day
		
		
	Shift Controls Explained:
		Target <Value> -
			Specifiy the value to transition to during this shift
		Start Hour -
			Specify the hour at which this shift will start. Shift do not need to be created chronologically
		Is This A Light -
			Specify if the subject is a light.
			IMPORTANT: Lights must be properly identified if they are to transition properly
	
	*NEW*
	Forecasts Controls Explained:
		Light/ Heavy Clouds/ Rain Alpha -
			Specifies the alpha values during this particular weather condtion
		Sun Intensity -
			Modifies the brightness of the sun, good to turn down during rain
		Lightning Intensity -
			Turn this to a high value like 3 or 4 if you want lightning during this weather conditions
			
	
Weather conditions are selected at random, and given a random duration between 0-24 hours.
When this duration expires, a new Forecast is chosen and duration set.
